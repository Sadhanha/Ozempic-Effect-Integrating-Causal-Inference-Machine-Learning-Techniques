# Ozempic-Effectiveness-Integrating-Causal-Inference

### Overview

The project aims to address the business problem of effectively targeting and treating obese and hypertensive patients aged 40 to 75. The primary focus is to identify patterns and actionable insights from a healthcare dataset, particularly concerning the prescription and use of medications like Ozempic.

### Objectives

1. Analyze patient demographics and treatment patterns.
2. Assess the effectiveness of medications, especially Ozempic.
3. Conduct demographic-specific cost analysis.
4. Provide recommendations for targeted healthcare interventions and patient education programs.

### Methodology

- **Data Source**: Medical records and prescription data.
- **Preprocessing**: Cleaning missing values, encoding categorical variables, and extracting relevant features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing demographic distributions, diagnosis frequencies, and medication prescription patterns using visualizations.
- **Model Selection and Evaluation**: Various models, including LassoCV, LogisticRegressionCV, Random Forest, and Neural Networks, were employed. Performance was measured using cross-validation, accuracy score, mean squared error, and RÂ² score.


### Conclusion

The project provided crucial insights into healthcare provision for obese and hypertensive patients, highlighting areas for improvement and strategies to enhance patient care and optimize healthcare resources.
